Documentation updates (project-level)

Updated README.md to clearly define BeatSmith’s purpose, core workflow, and usage patterns (including reproducible runs via seed/salt).

Updated SECURITY.md to document safe operation expectations (e.g., remote source usage, licensing considerations, and avoiding unsafe behaviors).

Updated ROADMAP.md to reflect the project’s near-term stabilization priorities (runtime correctness, deterministic runs, better output guarantees) and longer-term enhancements.

Import/runtime stability fixes

Resolved a chain of ImportError failures by restoring/adding expected module APIs that the CLI imports (e.g., missing functions like infer_bpm_for_label and the expected apply_* FX entry points).

Standardized module boundaries so cli.py imports are satisfied by audio.py and fx.py without requiring “ad hoc” edits per missing symbol.

trim_silence call alignment

Fixed the TypeError: trim_silence() got an unexpected keyword argument 'db' by aligning the CLI callsite to the actual trim_silence signature (and keeping parameter naming consistent across the project).

FX pipeline functional completeness

Ensured the FX layer exposes the functions the CLI expects (compression, EQ, modulation, reverb, etc.), either via wrappers or canonical implementations, to prevent “missing function” failures during production runs.

Output reliability (“never returns nothing”)

Implemented a robust fallback strategy so runs do not silently produce zero samples:

Added a source acquisition timeout (default 60s, adjustable) to prevent endless “search with no yield.”

Added a no-progress timeout (default 60s, adjustable) to detect “generation stuck at zero output.”

Added an emergency synthesis fallback (configurable) to guarantee output even when remote source acquisition fails or is throttled.

Observability and troubleshooting improvements

Added/expanded verbose operational logging so the tool reports:

why candidates were skipped (too small, decode fail, reuse suppression, etc.),

how far it got in selection/generation,

and summary statistics for “what happened” instead of failing silently.

Removed reliance on a missing global (VERBOSE) and standardized verbosity control via CLI flags/log configuration.

Determinism and reproducibility

Preserved deterministic behavior via the seed/salt approach while still supporting randomized selection and variation generation.

Operational safety and “graceful recovery”

When trimming eliminates a segment (or other transforms yield empties), the pipeline now recovers by retrying with safer settings rather than quietly dropping everything.

Net effect: the project was moved from “iteratively failing on missing symbols and producing zero output with unclear reasons” to a state where imports are consistent, the CLI aligns with module APIs, production runs are explainable via logs, and runs are strongly biased to produce usable output within bounded time.
